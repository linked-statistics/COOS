			<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>

			<p>The Official Statistics community has been collaborating for some years in order to define business models aiming at building common representations of its processes and information. These works, mostly conducted under the auspices of the UNECE High-Level Group for the Modernisation of Official Statistics (ModernStats), include the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM), the Generic Statistical Information Model (GSIM), and the Generic Activity Model for Statistical Organisation (GAMSO).</p>
				
			<p>GSBPM provides a framework to describe the building blocks of statistical production in terms of sub-processes. Its main goal is to help statistical organizations standardize their statistical production processes. It was the first ModernStats model to be published, back in 2008, and has been widely used by national and international statistical agencies since then.</p> 
				
			<p>GAMSO provides a framework to describe the building blocks of statistical production in terms of activities. It complements the GSBPM in two ways: (i) by covering areas beyond the scope of GSBPM, and (ii) by providing a business capability view of statistical production itself.</p> 
				
			<p>GSIM complements both GSBPM and GAMSO by providing a catalogue of information objects to describe statistical data and metadata. It functions as a reference framework consisting of a set of standardised information objects to be used in statistical production.</p>

			<p>As more and more statistical offices turn to semantic standards in order to formalize their data and metadata, it is time to build on our international core models to establish common foundations on which the different works can develop in a coherent way. This should be done using a formal framework that allows interoperability, activation and globally unique identification.</p>

			<p>This paper proposes a first try at a base OWL vocabulary for Official Statistics. It suggests formal representations for the core concepts used in our domain. It builds on a set of well-known OWL vocabularies, namely SKOS, PROV, ORG, DCAT and the Dublin Core.</p>

			<p>In the following sections, we stay at a very general model and deal with the following domains: statistical activities, products and actors. For more precise definitions like those that can be found in the GSIM or in CSPA, we refer to previous works: [[GSBPM-LM]] and [[GSIM-LM]] respectively.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The ontology covers statististical activities, organizations and products.</p>

			<section id="objectives">
				<h3>Objectives and scope</h3>
				<p>The ontology does not aim to cover the domains exhaustively. Inclusion criteria for a concept are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The concept helps clarifying and harmonizing the terminology</li>
					<li>The concept helps brigding constructs from different models</li>
					<li>The concept helps connecting statistical models to other well-known vocabularies</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The ontology also defines a large number of individuals (class instances) in order to standardize their naming and identification.</p>

			<h2>Activities</h2>
			<section id="activities-gsbpm">
				<h3>Base GSBPM model</h3>
				<p>A first approach to modeling statistical activities, based on the GSBPM, is presented in http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1551/article-06.pdf. Basically, three classes are defined in this GSBPM ontology, which are depicted in the following figure.</p>
				<p><code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> is a subclass of both <code>prov:Activity</code> and <code>skos:Concept</code>. Using SKOS allows us to organize the activities in schemes, like GSBPM or GAMSO. Using PROV allows us to specify who undertakes an activity and what entities it consumes or produces.</p>

				<p><code>Phase</code> and <code>SubProcess</code> are both subclasses of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> and represent respectively the concepts of a GSBPM phase and GSBPM sub-process.</p>

				<p>The ontology also defines an individual for each GSBPM phase or subprocess, as well as two specific individuals: the <code>GSBPM</code> itself, which is viewed as as a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> (the scheme of all the GSBPM phases and subprocesses), and <code>statisticalProductionProcess</code>, which is an instance of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> that represents statistical production process as a whole.</p>

				<p>The links between the different individuals are represented by the usual SKOS properties: all the sub-processes of a phase have a <code>skos:broader</code> link to the phase, and each phase has a <code>skos:broader</code> link to the <code>statisticalProductionProcess</code> individual.</p>

				<p>The following figure summarizes the vocabulary terms defined until now.</p>

				<h3>Adding GAMSO</h3>
				<p>Introducing GAMSO in this framework is not very difficult, but raises a few interesting questions. If we look at the terminology used in GAMSO, we find that the main concepts used are activity and activity area.</p>

				<p>For the concept of activity, the simpler idea is to introduce a <code>StatisticalActivity</code> class that would be a daughter of <code>prov:Activity</code> and a mother of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>. All second-level GAMSO activities would be instances of this <code>StatisticalActivity</code> class.</p>

				<p>For the activity areas, the question is a bit more tricky: are these really activities, or just boxes where we classify the second-level activities? In the first case, activity areas will be themselves instances of <code>StatisticalActivity</code>, in the second case (represented below) they will just be instances of <code>skos:Concept</code> or of a specific <code>StatisticalActivityArea</code> sub-class. The answer can in fact be different for each GAMSO activity area: that does not change the global structure of the ontology.</p>

				<figure id="image-gamso">
					<img src="img/coos-gamso.png" alt="GAMSO vocabulary overview" title="GAMSO vocabulary overview"/>
					<figcaption>GAMSO vocabulary overview</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>As previously for the GSBPM, individuals would be defined for each activity and activity area, and the GAMSO itself would be a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> with all four activity areas having <code>skos:broader</code> links to it.</p>

				<p>In addition, we need two properties to describe how an <code>Activity</code> relates to a <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>supports</code>: it means to enable to perform or function. We say that an <code>Activity</code>, e.g. GAMOS Manage Statistical Methods, <code>supports</code> a <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>, e.g. a GSBPM Phase.</li>
					<li><code>uses</code>: it means to require to perform or function. We say that a <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>, e.g. GSBPM Overarching Processes, <code>uses</code> an <code>Activity</code>, e.g. Manage IT.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Properties <code>uses</code> and <code>supports</code> are inverses of each other. They are weaker (looser) forms of dependencies than partitive relationships: <code>uses/supports</code> are about function whereas <code>part/whole</code> are about constitution.</p>

				<p>A few points should be studied further:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The notes of the second-level GAMSO activities are very well structured, so it would be possible to replace (or double) them with lists of individual concepts for third-level activities. For example, activity 2.1.1 ('Identify disruptions and capability improvements') would be added in the figure above with a <code>skso:broader</code> link to the activity 2.1.</li>
					<li>We could refine the model by introducing more specific classes, for example <code>StatisticalSupportActivity</code>, <code>StatisticalStategicActivity</code>, etc. That should be justified by well-defined use cases.</li>
					<li>The relation between the GSBPM as a concept scheme and as an activity area has to be precised. For now we can use a simple <code>rdf:seeAlso</code> property, but in a totally integrated view, all GSBPM and GAMSO artefacts would go in a single <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> (the GAMSO) and the GSBPM would not be a concept scheme anymore: it would be an instance of both <code>StatisticalArea</code> and <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>.</li>
					<li>There is a remaining question about the over-arching processes of the GSBPM. They probably should be viewed as components of the GSBPM concept scheme, and instances of class <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> which are not phases or sub-processes; an additional <code>OverArchingProcess</code> (or <code>TransverseActivity</code>, etc.) class could be created.</li>
					<li>Some clarification should be made on the relations between similar GSBPM over-arching processes and GAMSO activities, notably 'Quality Management' (GSBPM) and 'Manage Quality' (GAMSO 3.10).</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section id="activities-task">
				<h3>More detailed activities</h3>
				<p>The previous definitions stay in the framework of the GAMSO/GSBPM, but more precise notions will be needed by the NSIs for the more detailed modelization of their statistical activities. COOS users can adopt different names for these more specific activities that are scoped by a given GSBPM sub-process or overarching activity, but COOS defines the generic <code>Task</code> class as a common term for better interoperability. Tasks can be more or less fine-grained and form hierarchies.</p>

				<div class="issue">
					<p>Include examples of tasks.</p>

		<section id="organizations">
			<h2>Organizations</h2>
			<p>The following classes are defined:</p>

			<figure id="image-org">
				<img src="img/coos-org.png" alt="Organizations vocabulary overview" title="Organizations vocabulary overview"/>
				<figcaption>Organizations vocabulary overview</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<ul>
				<li><code>NationalStatisticalInstitute</code>: The main producer of official statistics in a country and/or the organization responsible for coordinating all activities related to the development, production, and dissemination of official statistics in the national statistical system. The actual name given to the national statistical office in a country may be National Statistical Institute (NSI), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), National Statistical Agency (NSA), Central Statistical Agency (CSA), Central Statistics Agency (CSA), etc.</li>
				<li><code>InternationalAgency</code>: A body with an international membership, scope, or presence whose primary role is the production of official statistics. There are many types of international organizations. One way of categorizing them is to distinguish between intergovernmental organizations, supranational organizations and international non-governmental organizations.</li>
			</ul>	
			
			<p>The use of <code>org:Organization</code> as a mother class allows to benefit from all the constructs of the ORG ontology, for example the <code>org:hasUnit</code>/<code>org:unitOf</code> properties for the representation of the hierarchical links between organizations. The use of <code>prov:Organization</code> allows to capture the relations between organizations, activities and products, for example <code>prov:wasAssociatedWith</code> can link a statistical activity to the NSI that conducts it.</p>

			<p>It would also be useful to include in the base ontology instances of <code>StatisticalOrganization</code> representing the existing national statistical institutes and international statistical organizations. This would provide in particular a shared global identifier for each of these organisms.</p>

			<div class="issue">
				<p>Is there an "official" list of international agencies and NSIs?</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section id="products">
			<h2>Products</h2>
			<p>The COOS ontology defines two base classes in the "Products" domain: <code>StatisticalProduct</code> and <code>StatisticalDataset</code>.</p>

			<div class="issue">
				<p>Provide textual definition of Statistical Product and Statistical Dataset.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Here again, the PROV vocabulary is useful, in particular to provide provenance information on products and to link them to activities and organizations (for example <code>prov:wasGeneratedBy</code> from a product to an activity).</p>

			<p>The <code>StatisticalDataset</code> class is also declared as a daughter of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, which allows to reuse the DCAT (or StatDCAT-AP) possibilities, in particular to document datasets and their different distributions, group them in catalogues, etc.</p>

			<figure id="image-prod">

		</section>

		<section id="conclusion">
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>This paper proposes a collection of core concepts for official statistics, expressed as OWL classes backed by constructs of well-known standard vocabularies. Work still needs to be done on the precise definition of these concepts, on their properties and on their identification.</p>

			<p>More effort is also needed to articulate this base ontology with more sectorial and in-depth works existing on GSIM, CSPA or the SIMS model for quality metadata.</p>

			<p>The management and governance of these different initiatives need also to be established.</p>
