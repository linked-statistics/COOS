			<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>

			<p>As more and more statistical offices turn to semantic standards in order to formalize their data and metadata, it is time to build on our international core models to establish common foundations on which the different works can develop in a coherent way. This should be done using a formal framework that allows interoperability, activation and globally unique identification.</p>

			<p>This paper proposes a first try at a base OWL vocabulary for Official Statistics. It suggests formal representations for the core concepts used in our domain. It builds on a set of well-known OWL vocabularies, namely SKOS, PROV, ORG, DCAT and the Dublin Core.</p>

			<p>In the following sections, we stay at a very general model and deal with the following domains: statistical activities, products and actors. For more precise definitions like those that can be found in the GSIM or in CSPA, we refer to previous works: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1654/article-03.pdf and http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1654/article-06.pdf respectively.</p>

			<h2>Activities</h2>
			<section id="activities-gsbpm">
				<h3>Base GSBPM model</h3>
				<p>A first approach to modeling statistical activities, based on the GSBPM, is presented in http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1551/article-06.pdf. Basically, three classes are defined in this GSBPM ontology, which are depicted in the following figure.</p>
				<p><code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> is a subclass of both <code>prov:Activity</code> and <code>skos:Concept</code>. Using SKOS allows us to organize the activities in schemes, like GSBPM or GAMSO. Using PROV allows us to specify who undertakes an activity and what entities it consumes or produces.</p>

				<p><code>Phase</code> and <code>SubProcess</code> are both subclasses of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> and represent respectively the concepts of a GSBPM phase and GSBPM sub-process.</p>

				<p>The ontology also defines an individual for each GSBPM phase or subprocess, as well as two specific individuals: the <code>GSBPM</code> itself, which is viewed as as a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> (the scheme of all the GSBPM phases and subprocesses), and <code>statisticalProductionProcess</code>, which is an instance of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> that represents statistical production process as a whole.</p>

				<p>The links between the different individuals are represented by the usual SKOS properties: all the sub-processes of a phase have a <code>skos:broader</code> link to the phase, and each phase has a <code>skos:broader</code> link to the <code>statisticalProductionProcess</code> individual.</p>

				<p>The following figure summarizes the vocabulary terms defined until now.</p>

			<section id="activities-gamso">
				<h3>Adding GAMSO</h3>
				<p>Introducing GAMSO in this framework is not very difficult, but raises a few interesting questions. If we look at the terminology used in GAMSO, we find that the main concepts used are activity and activity area.</p>

				<p>For the concept of activity, the simpler idea is to introduce a <code>StatisticalActivity</code> class that would be a daughter of <code>prov:Activity</code> and a mother of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>. All second-level GAMSO activities would be instances of this <code>StatisticalActivity</code> class.</p>

				<p>For the activity areas, the question is a bit more tricky: are these really activities, or just boxes where we classify the second-level activities? In the first case, activity areas will be themselves instances of <code>StatisticalActivity</code>, in the second case (represented below) they will just be instances of <code>skos:Concept</code> or of a specific <code>StatisticalActivityArea</code> sub-class. The answer can in fact be different for each GAMSO activity area: that does not change the global structure of the ontology.</p>

				<figure id="image-gamso">
					<img src="img/coos-gamso.png" alt="GAMSO vocabulary overview" title="GAMSO vocabulary overview"/>
					<figcaption>GAMSO vocabulary overview</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>As previously for the GSBPM, individuals would be defined for each activity and activity area, and the GAMSO itself would be a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> with all four activity areas having <code>skos:broader</code> links to it.</p>

				<p>A few points should be studied further:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The notes of the second-level GAMSO activities are very well structured, so it would be possible to replace (or double) them with lists of individual concepts for third-level activities. For example, activity 2.1.1 ('Identify disruptions and capability improvements') would be added in the figure above with a <code>skso:broader</code> link to the activity 2.1.</li>
					<li>We could refine the model by introducing more specific classes, for example <code>StatisticalSupportActivity</code>, <code>StatisticalStategicActivity</code>, etc. That should be justified by well-defined use cases.</li>
					<li>The relation between the GSBPM as a concept scheme and as an activity area has to be precised. For now we can use a simple <code>rdf:seeAlso</code> property, but in a totally integrated view, all GSBPM and GAMSO artefacts would go in a single <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> (the GAMSO) and the GSBPM would not be a concept scheme anymore: it would be an instance of both <code>StatisticalArea</code> and <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>.</li>
					<li>There is a remaining question about the over-arching processes of the GSBPM. They probably should be viewed as components of the GSBPM concept scheme, and instances of class <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> which are not phases or sub-processes; an additional <code>OverArchingProcess</code> (or <code>TransverseActivity</code>, etc.) class could be created.</li>
					<li>Some clarification should be made on the relations between similar GSBPM over-arching processes and GAMSO activities, notably 'Quality Management' (GSBPM) and 'Manage Quality' (GAMSO 3.10).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The previous definitions stay in the framework of the GAMSO/GSBPM, but more precise notions will be needed by the NSIs for the modelization of their statistical activities. For example, Insee created in its base ontology (https://github.com/InseeFr/Ontologies/blob/master/insee-base.ttl) the <code>StatisticalOperation</code> class which can be grouped into series and families.</p>

				<figure id="image-ops">
					<img src="img/coos-ops.png" alt="Operations vocabulary overview" title="Operations vocabulary overview"/>
					<figcaption>Operations vocabulary overview</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>As an illustration, the Census is a family of operations, with the general census (until 1999) and the rolling census (that replaced it) being two series, and each census a statistical operation. The inclusion links (series → family, operation → series) are rendered by the standard Dublin Core <code>dcterms:hasPart</code>/<code>dcterms:isPartOf</code> properties.</p>

				<p>It is clear that this model can be anchored to the GAMSO/GSBPM framework, or even included to form a more comprehensive model, by declaring <code>StatisticalOperation</code> a subclass of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>.</p>

		<section id="organizations">
			<h2>Organizations</h2>
			<p>The following classes are defined in Insee’s base ontology and could be moved to international level:</p>

			<figure id="image-org">
				<img src="img/coos-org.png" alt="Organizations vocabulary overview" title="Organizations vocabulary overview"/>
				<figcaption>Organizations vocabulary overview</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>The use of <code>org:Organization</code> as a mother class allows to benefit from all the constructs of the ORG ontology, for example the <code>org:hasUnit</code>/<code>org:unitOf</code> properties for the representation of the hierarchical links between organizations. The use of <code>prov:Organization</code> allows to capture the relations between organizations, activities and products, for example <code>prov:wasAssociatedWith</code> can link a statistical activity to the NSI that conducts it.</p>

			<p>It would also be useful to include in the base ontology instances of <code>StatisticalOrganization</code> representing the existing national statistical institutes and international statistical organizations. This would provide in particular a shared global identifier for each of these organisms.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="products">
			<h2>Products</h2>
			<p>Among the classes defined by Insee (see figure below), at least <code>StatisticalProduct</code> and <code>StatisticalDataset</code> could be moved to an international base ontology.</p>

			<p>Here again, the PROV vocabulary is useful, in particular to provide provenance information on products and to link them to activities and organizations (for example <code>prov:wasGeneratedBy</code> from a product to an activity).</p>

			<p>The <code>StatisticalDataset</code> class is also declared as a daughter of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, which allows to reuse the DCAT (or StatDCAT-AP) possibilities, in particular to document datasets and their different distributions, group them in catalogues, etc.</p>

				<img src="img/coos-prod.png" alt="Product vocabulary overview" title="Product vocabulary overview"/>
				<figcaption>Product vocabulary overview</figcaption>

		</section>

		<section id="conclusion">
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>This paper proposes a collection of core concepts for official statistics, expressed as OWL classes backed by constructs of well-known standard vocabularies. Work still needs to be done on the precise definition of these concepts, on their properties and on their identification.</p>

			<p>More effort is also needed to articulate this base ontology with more sectorial and in-depth works existing on GSIM, CSPA or the SIMS model for quality metadata.</p>

			<p>The management and governance of these different initiatives need also to be established.</p>
