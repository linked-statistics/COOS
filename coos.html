			<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>

			<p>The Official Statistics community has been collaborating for some years in order to define business models aiming at building common representations of its processes and information. These works, mostly conducted under the auspices of the UNECE High-Level Group for the Modernisation of Official Statistics (ModernStats), include the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM), the Generic Statistical Information Model (GSIM), the Generic Activity Model for Statistical Organisation (GAMSO), and the Common Statistical Data Architecture (CSDA).</p>
				
			<p>GSBPM provides a framework to describe the building blocks of statistical production in terms of sub-processes. Its main goal is to help statistical organizations standardize their statistical production processes. It was the first ModernStats model to be published, back in 2008, and has been widely used by national and international statistical agencies since then.</p> 
				
			<p>GAMSO provides a framework to describe the building blocks of statistical production in terms of activities. It complements the GSBPM in two ways: (i) by covering areas beyond the scope of GSBPM, and (ii) by providing a business capability view of statistical production itself.</p> 
				
			<p>GSIM complements both GSBPM and GAMSO by providing a catalogue of information objects to describe statistical data and metadata. It functions as a reference framework consisting of a set of standardised information objects to be used in statistical production.</p>

			<p>CSDA provides a capability framework cataloguing the mayor abilities a statistical organization has to use, produce, share and manage data and metadata. CSDA integrates with the GSBPM and GAMSO by enabling processes and activities related to the lifecycle management of GSIM information objects. </p>

			<p>As more and more statistical offices turn to semantic standards in order to formalize their data and metadata, it is time to build on our international core models to establish common foundations on which the different works can develop in a coherent way. This should be done using a formal framework that allows interoperability, activation and globally unique identification.</p>

			<p>This paper proposes a first try at a base OWL vocabulary for Official Statistics. It suggests formal representations for the core concepts used in our domain. It builds on a set of well-known OWL vocabularies, namely SKOS, PROV, ORG, DCAT and the Dublin Core.</p>

			<p>In the following sections, we stay at a very general model and deal with the following domains: statistical activities, products and actors. For more precise definitions like those that can be found in the GSIM or in CSPA, we refer to previous works: [[GSBPM-LM]] and [[GSIM-LM]] respectively.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The ontology covers statististical activities, organizations and products.</p>

			<section id="objectives">
				<h3>Objectives and scope</h3>
				<p>The ontology does not aim to cover the domains exhaustively. Inclusion criteria for a concept are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The concept helps clarifying and harmonizing the terminology</li>
					<li>The concept helps brigding constructs from different models</li>
					<li>The concept helps connecting statistical models to other well-known vocabularies</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The ontology also defines a large number of individuals (class instances) in order to standardize their naming and identification.</p>

			<h2>Activities</h2>

			<p>A large part of the COOS is related to the activities performed by statistical organizations. Indeed, the GSBPM model was one of the first to be standardized at the international level, and remains the most widely used of the Unece models. The GAMSO appeared later, and was subsequently articulated with the GSBPM in a coherent scheme.</p>

			<p>In this section, we will follow this historic view and start by describing the COOS artefacts that originate from the GSBPM, then add the GAMSO view. Other useful COOS constructs related to the Official Statistics activities are listed in a third sub-section.</p>

			<section id="activities-gsbpm">

				<h3>Base GSBPM model</h3>

				<div class="issue" title="Add short GSBPM overview">
					<ul>
						<li>Evolution of the model, now in version 5.1.</li>
						<li>Use cases.</li>
						<li>Structure</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>A first approach to modeling statistical activities, based on the GSBPM, is presented in [[GSBPM-LM]]. Basically, three classes are defined in this GSBPM ontology: <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>, <code>Phase</code> and <code>SubProcess</code>.</p>

				<p><code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> is a sub-class of both <code>prov:Activity</code> and <code>skos:Concept</code>. Using SKOS allows us to organize the activities in schemes, like GSBPM or GAMSO. Using PROV allows us to specify who undertakes an activity and what entities it consumes or produces.</p>

				<pre class="example" title="Example of statistical production activity">
				ex:produce-study a coos:StatisticalProductionActivity ;
					rdfs:label "Produce study"@en .
				</pre>

				<p><code>Phase</code> and <code>SubProcess</code> are both sub-classes of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> and represent respectively the concepts of a GSBPM phase and GSBPM sub-process.</p>

				<pre class="example nohighlight" title="Examples of GSBPM phase and sub-process">
				&lt;http://id.unece.org/activities/phase/6&gt; a coos:Phase ;
					skos:notation "6" ;
					skos:prefLabel "Analyse"@en .					

				&lt;http://id.unece.org/activities/subProcess/2.3&gt; a coos:SubProcess ;
					skos:notation "7.2" ;
					skos:prefLabel "Produce dissemination products"@en .
				</pre>

				<p>In addition, COOS defines the <code>OverarchingActivity</code> class to represent what is called overarching process by the GSBPM.</p>

				<div class="issue" title="Overarching process or activity">
					<p>Add a sentence to explain why over-arching process became over-arching activity.</p>
				</div>

				<pre class="example nohighlight" title="Examples of GSBPM overarching activity">
				&lt;http://id.unece.org/activities/overarchingActivity/0.2&gt; a coos:OverarchingActivity ;
					skos:notation "0.2"	;
					skos:prefLabel "Metadata Management"@en .					
				</pre>

				<p>The ontology actually defines an individual for each GSBPM phase, sub-process, and overarching activities, as well as two specific individuals: the <code>GSBPM</code> itself, which is viewed as as a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> (the scheme of all the GSBPM phases, sub-processes and overarching activities), and <code>statisticalProductionProcess</code>, which is an instance of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> that represents statistical production process as a whole.</p>

				<p>The links between the different individuals are represented by the usual SKOS properties: all the sub-processes of a phase have a <code>skos:broader</code> link to the phase, and each phase has a <code>skos:broader</code> link to the <code>statisticalProductionProcess</code> individual. Additionally, the idea that each phase is made up of its different sub-processes can be represented by using the Dublin Core <code>dcterms:hasPart</code> and <code>dcterms:isPartOf</code> properties.</p>

				<pre class="example nohighlight" title="Example of GSBPM phase and sub-process">
				&lt;http://id.unece.org/activities/phase/2&gt; a coos:Phase ;
					skos:notation "2" ;
					skos:prefLabel "Design"@en ;
					skos:narrower &lt;http://id.unece.org/activities/subProcess/2.3&gt; .

				&lt;http://id.unece.org/activities/subProcess/2.3&gt; a coos:SubProcess ;
					skos:notation "2.3" ;
					skos:prefLabel "Design collection"@en ;
					skos:broader &lt;http://id.unece.org/activities/phase/2&gt; ;
					skos:isPartOf &lt;http://id.unece.org/activities/phase/2&gt; .

			<section id="activities-gamso">
				<h3>Adding GAMSO</h3>
				<p>Introducing GAMSO in this framework is not very difficult, but raises a few interesting questions. If we look at the terminology used in GAMSO, we find that the main concepts used are activity and activity area.</p>

				<p>For the concept of activity, the simpler idea is to introduce a <code>StatisticalActivity</code> class that would be a daughter of <code>prov:Activity</code> and a mother of <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>. All second-level GAMSO activities would be instances of this <code>StatisticalActivity</code> class.</p>

				<p>For the activity areas, the question is a bit more tricky: are these really activities, or just boxes where we classify the second-level activities? In the first case, activity areas will be themselves instances of <code>StatisticalActivity</code>, in the second case (represented below) they will just be instances of <code>skos:Concept</code> or of a specific <code>StatisticalActivityArea</code> sub-class. The answer can in fact be different for each GAMSO activity area: that does not change the global structure of the ontology.</p>

				<figure id="image-gamso">
					<img src="img/coos-gamso.png" alt="GAMSO vocabulary overview" title="GAMSO vocabulary overview"/>
					<figcaption>GAMSO vocabulary overview</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>As previously for the GSBPM, individuals would be defined for each activity and activity area, and the GAMSO itself would be a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> with all four activity areas having <code>skos:broader</code> links to it.</p>

				<p>In addition, we need two properties to describe how an <code>Activity</code> relates to a <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>supports</code>: it means to enable to perform or function. We say that an <code>Activity</code>, e.g. GAMSO Manage Statistical Methods, <code>supports</code> a <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>, e.g. a GSBPM Phase.</li>
					<li><code>uses</code>: it means to require to perform or function. We say that a <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>, e.g. GSBPM Overarching Processes, <code>uses</code> an <code>Activity</code>, e.g. Manage IT.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Properties <code>uses</code> and <code>supports</code> are inverses of each other. They are weaker (looser) forms of dependencies than partitive relationships: <code>uses/supports</code> are about function whereas <code>part/whole</code> are about constitution.</p>

				<p>A few points should be studied further:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The notes of the second-level GAMSO activities are very well structured, so it would be possible to replace (or double) them with lists of individual concepts for third-level activities. For example, activity 2.1.1 ('Identify disruptions and capability improvements') would be added in the figure above with a <code>skso:broader</code> link to the activity 2.1.</li>
					<li>We could refine the model by introducing more specific classes, for example <code>StatisticalSupportActivity</code>, <code>StatisticalStategicActivity</code>, etc. That should be justified by well-defined use cases.</li>
					<li>The relation between the GSBPM as a concept scheme and as an activity area has to be precised. For now we can use a simple <code>rdf:seeAlso</code> property, but in a totally integrated view, all GSBPM and GAMSO artefacts would go in a single <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> (the GAMSO) and the GSBPM would not be a concept scheme anymore: it would be an instance of both <code>StatisticalArea</code> and <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code>.</li>
					<li>There is a remaining question about the over-arching processes of the GSBPM. They probably should be viewed as components of the GSBPM concept scheme, and instances of class <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> which are not phases or sub-processes; an additional <code>OverArchingProcess</code> (or <code>TransverseActivity</code>, etc.) class could be created.</li>
					<li>Some clarification should be made on the relations between similar GSBPM over-arching processes and GAMSO activities, notably 'Quality Management' (GSBPM) and 'Manage Quality' (GAMSO 3.10).</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section id="activities-other">
				<h3>Adding GSIM and CSDA</h3>
				<p>Adding the Generic Statistical Information Model (GSIM) in this framework allows us to refine <code>StatisticalActivity</code> even further. Parallel to <code>StatisticalProductionActivity</code> we can define three additional sub-classes of <code>StatisticalActivity</code>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>StatisticalProgram:</code> it is essentially a set of activities carried out to produce statistics. These statistics are about the set of units in scope for the program, e.g. “All persons with a university degree”, within a given subject field, e.g. income statistics, tourism, etc.</li>
					<li><code>StatisticalProgramCycle:</code> statistical program activities are often repeated over time in iterations called cycles. A StatisticalProgramCycle is one of those iterations for a specific time and geography.</li>
					<li><code>StatisticalSupportProgram:</code> these are all centralized, corporate-level activities that allow statistical programs to exist and operate. These span from requirements elicitation, design and implementation (GSBPM Phases 1-3) to metadata management data, metadata and quality management (GSBPM overarching processes) and the statistical portion of capability development and corporate support (GAMSO).</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<p>Another dimension to consider is that of information capabilities. A capability is an ability a statistical organization possesses to undertake a specific activity. It is only achieved through the integration of all relevant capability elements (e.g. methods, processes, standards and frameworks, IT systems and people skills). The notion of capability is often used in enterprise architecture approaches like TOGAF or, in the statistical domain, the Common Statistical Data Architecture [[CSDA]]. Capabilities can be mapped to strategic goals and objectives and provide a useful starting point to map lower level elements such as business process and functions, applications and technology assets.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><code>Core capabilities: </code> capabilities the organization needs to execute its core business, i.e. the production of statistics. They generally map to phases in GSBPM.</li>
					<li><code>Cross-cutting capabilities: </code>capabilities used to formulate and implement the policies that the organization chooses for its internal operations. They generally map to corporate support in GAMSO and overarching processes in GSBPM.</li>
				</ul>

				<pre class="example" title="Example of capability">
				ex:csda-data-integration a coos:Capability ;
					rdfs:label "Data integration"@en ;
					skos:definition "The ability to combine, link, relate and/or align different data sets in order to create an integrated information set."@en .
				</pre>

				<div class="issue" title="To do on capabilities">
					<ul>
						<li>Add an example of capability from geospatial domain ("Develop and apply services for smarter statistical-geospatial integration" from GeoStat4).</li>
						<li>Add text about link between capabilities and GAMSO area "Develop capabilities" as illustration.</li>
						<li>The ESS has a Business Capabilities model that might be worth checking https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/statistical-enterprise-architecture/document/ess-earf-business-capabilities-model (See Figure 2 ESS Business Capabilities model – Levels 0 & 1)</li>
						<li>Insert final figure from https://github.com/linked-statistics/COOS/issues/46</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</section>
			
			<section id="activities-task">
				<h3>More detailed activities</h3>
				<p>The previous definitions stay in the framework of the GAMSO/GSBPM/GSIM/CSDA, but more precise notions will be needed by the NSIs for the more detailed modelization of their statistical activities. COOS users can adopt different names for these more specific activities that are scoped by a given GSBPM sub-process or overarching activity, but COOS defines the generic <code>Task</code> class as a common term for better interoperability. Tasks can be more or less fine-grained and form hierarchies.</p>

				<pre class="example" title="Example of task">
				ex:calculate-mean-wages a coos:Task ;
					rdfs:label "Calculate mean wages"@en ;
					skos:broader &lt;http://id.unece.org/activities/subProcess/5.7&gt; .

				ex:produce-study prov:wasInformedBy ex:calculate-mean-wages .
				</pre>

				<p>We see in this example how we can use PROV to represent links between activities: here we suppose that the "Produce study" activity uses the results of the "Calculate mean wages" task.</p>

				<p>As mentioned previously, the Task class can be used by NSIs to create instances for their own needs. Two NSIs can create their own "Calculate mean wages" task, and only their labels would indicate that they do similar things. In certain cases however, it could be useful to define standard sub-classes of Task for some widely used and specific types of tasks, for example record linkage or hot-deck imputation. This would allow for example to refer to relevant methodology.</p>

			<h2>Organizations</h2>
			<p>The following classes are defined:</p>

			<figure id="image-org">
				<img src="img/coos-org.png" alt="Organizations vocabulary overview" title="Organizations vocabulary overview"/>
				<figcaption>Organizations vocabulary overview</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<ul>
				<li><code>StatisticalOrganization</code>: Organization, or unit within an organization, whose primary role is the production of official statistics.</li>
				<li><code>NationalStatisticalInstitute</code>: The main producer of official statistics in a country and/or the organization responsible for coordinating all activities related to the development, production, and dissemination of official statistics in the national statistical system. The actual name given to the national statistical office in a country may be National Statistical Institute (NSI), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), National Statistical Agency (NSA), Central Statistical Agency (CSA), Central Statistics Agency (CSA), etc.</li>
				<li><code>InternationalAgency</code>: A body with an international membership, scope, or presence whose primary role is the production of official statistics. There are many types of international organizations. One way of categorizing them is to distinguish between intergovernmental organizations, supranational organizations and international non-governmental organizations.</li>
			</ul>	
			
			<p>The use of <code>org:Organization</code> as a mother class allows to benefit from all the constructs of the ORG ontology, for example the <code>org:hasUnit</code>/<code>org:unitOf</code> properties for the representation of the hierarchical links between organizations. The use of <code>prov:Organization</code> allows to capture the relations between organizations, activities and products, for example <code>prov:wasAssociatedWith</code> can link a statistical activity to the NSI that conducts it.</p>

			<p>It would also be useful to include in the base ontology instances of <code>StatisticalOrganization</code> representing the existing national statistical institutes and international statistical organizations. This would provide in particular a shared global identifier for each of these organisms.</p>

			<h2>Products</h2>

			<p class="ednote" title="Information objets">Introduce <code>InformationObject</code>, <code>StatisticalInformationObject</code> and <code>StatisticalEntity</code> here, even if they cover more than products.</p>

			<p>The COOS ontology defines two base classes in the "Products" domain: <code>StatisticalProduct</code> and <code>StatisticalDataset</code>.</p>

			<div class="issue">

			<p>Here again, the PROV vocabulary is useful, in particular to provide provenance information on products and to link them to activities and organizations (for example <code>prov:wasGeneratedBy</code> from a product to an activity).</p>

			<p>The <code>StatisticalDataset</code> class is also declared as a daughter of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, which allows to reuse the DCAT (or StatDCAT-AP) possibilities, in particular to document datasets and their different distributions, group them in catalogues, etc.</p>

			<p>In DDI-CDI ([[DDI-CDI]]), four basic structural types of organizing data sets have been defined: rectangular, event history, key-value pair, and dimensional. Here we add the 'graph' type, which covers also tree-like data. Several of the types could be used to structure the same data. There is not a canonical structure in all cases, though some data is much more amenable to one structure over the others.</p>

			<p>The types are defined roughly as follows:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>rectangular (or wide) - rows are units and columns are variables</li>
				<li>event history (or tall or long) - rows are based on the value for each variable, one unit at a time - and this could be visualized as rows are variables and columns are units</li>
				<li>dimensional - a pre-defined set of cells defined by the combination of categories, one from each of a set of dimensions (category sets), used to handle the value of some measure (variable) restricted to the cell</li>
				<li>key-value - a set of values, each associated with some key</li>
				<li>graph - datapoints are nodes and relationships between them are edges in a graph structure</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Dimensional data are usually associated with aggregates. Key-value data are often taken from scraping the web. Even-history is used to describe events over some time period.</p>

			<p>The nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio are not used to differentiate datasets. Rather, they are families of datatypes used to describe variables. Nominal data are those conforming to a finite set of categories with no other conditions (sex categories). Ordinal data are those conforming to an ordered finite set of categories, but the difference between adjacent categories is not necessarily uniform (Likert scale measures of satisfaction). Interval data are numeric with no zero (absence of quantity) defined (Celsius temperature). Ratio data are numeric with a defined zero (Kelvin temperature). These apply to any kind of statistical data.</p>

			<p>The distinction between aggregate and unit data is based on the definition of the variables in the dataset. A dataset can contain both unit and aggregate data.</p>

			<p>Access restrictions on data (e.g., public, restricted, private) are assigned by the business and can change over the life-cycle of the dataset.</p>

			<p>The domain for a dataset is defined by the subject field that data apply to. However, some datasets are merged from others, so a merged set can have the combination of its constituents. There seems to be no restriction on the number of subject fields.</p>

			<p>Mode of transmission is not definitional for a dataset, as a single dataset can be obtained multiple ways. The phases of GSBPM may not be useful, as a single dataset can pass through a phase without change. Further, the phases impose a usage criterion (data for collection; data for editing; etc.) that seems arbitrary and would be useless in another domain (outside statistics).</p>

			<p>Similarly, the explorative, temporary, and organizational categorization is based on intent, rather than the data per se. Plus, the categorization could change without any change to the data. If we change the organizational structure described above (rectangular, etc.), then we should call that a new dataset.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>This paper proposes a collection of core concepts for official statistics, expressed as OWL constructs backed by elements of well-known standard vocabularies. Work still needs to be done on the precise definition of these concepts, on their properties and on their identification.</p>

			<p>More effort is also needed to articulate this base ontology with more sectorial and in-depth works existing on GSIM, CSPA or the SIMS model for quality metadata.</p>

			<p>The management and governance of these different initiatives need also to be established.</p>
