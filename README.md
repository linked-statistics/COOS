# COOS – Core ontology for official statistics


## What is COOS?

The COOS activity is conducted under the umbrella of the "Supporting Standards" [modernisation group](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/hlgbas/Modernisation+Groups) of the [Unece](https://unece.org/) and aims to create a common semantic model and vocabulary for Official Statistics. The ontology will allow a better formalization of the links between the ModernStats models (in particular the Generic Activity Model for Statistical Organizations – [GAMSO](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gamso), the Generic Statistical Business Process Model – [GSBPM](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsbpm), and the Generic Statistical Information Model – [GSIM](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsim)), and help to connect these models to existing RDF vocabularies like [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) or [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/).


## Products

The ontology is expressed as a [Turtle file](https://github.com/linked-statistics/COOS/blob/master/coos.ttl). This is the authoritative version of the vocabulary.

A [specification document](https://linked-statistics.github.io/COOS/coos.html) is also available. This is work in progress, using the template of a W3C Community Group report for practical purposes, but that does not presume of the final form of the document.

Other documents produced by the COOS activity are:

* a [URI and naming Policy](uri-policy.md)
* a [governance document](governance.md)


## Current work

Work on the COOS started in 2019 and produced a first version of the ontology (v0.4). The activity was paused in 2020, and restarted in 2021, leading to an expert review later that year. The ontology was enriched during 2022 and a public review was launched in November.


### Roadmap

Work on COOS will resume mid-2023, with the following activity plan:

* July: integration of public review feedback
* September: discussion of [issues remaining](https://github.com/linked-statistics/COOS/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Version+2+of+COOS%22)
* October: development of working examples and use cases
* November: submission to HLG-MOS for adoption
